I am Xunjian Yin, a second-year Master's student in the [Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology](https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/english/home/index.htm) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). My advisor is Prof. [Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/). Previously, I obtained my B.S. degree in [Computer Science](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/en/) from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).

My research interest lies in knowledge and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, 
1. I am committed to analyzing and researching the storage patterns of knowledge within large language models, aiming to uncover underlying structures and mechanisms (**Knowledge Storage Patterns**).
2. I work on better extracting the knowledge within the model as well as assessing the boundaries of the model's knowledge capabilities. (**Knowledge Extraction and Evaluation**)
3. I aspire to design methods that allow us to effectively manipulate and update the knowledge within these models, providing them with more flexible learning and adaptability (**Knowledge Manipulation and Updating**).
4. My goal is to design methods that can better leverage the knowledge within the model for reasoning and practical problem-solving, enhancing the model's applicability (**Knowledge Utilization for Reasoning and Problem Solving**).
